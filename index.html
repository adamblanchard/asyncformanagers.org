    <h1>Manifesto for Managers working in Async Software Development</h1>

    <blockquote cite="https://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/">
    "Asynchronous communication means I can take a step out for lunch and catch up on transcripts when I get back. Asynchronous communication means I can ask my coworker a question in-chat and not worry about bothering her since she’ll get back to me when she’s available. Asynchronous communication means I can go to rural Minnesota and feel like I’m working from the office like normal."
      
      - Zach Holman of GitHub

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Transparent and public communication over information control.</li>
      <li>Flexible working hours over synchronised schedules.</li>
      <li>Written information over verbal meetings.</li>
      <li>Remote-working over co-location.</li>
      <li>Trust and ownership over task delegation.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <h3>Meetings as a last resort</h3>
    Meetings are <a href="https://meetingking.com/meeting-cost-calculator/">really expensive</a>.

    <h3>Sync time is limited but important, use it well.</h3>

    <h3>Overcommunicate by default. More than you are comfortable with.</h3>
    It's cheap. Lose the ego. It's incredibly valuable. You can't rely on fast follow ups, so give more context and consider what someone might ask after your message and give them the answer already.

    Here's what you should include:
    1. Enough details to cover follow up questions - don't let it turn into a long delayed conversation.
    2. Response time expectations - when do you need an answer?
    3. As much context and supporting info as possible - documentation, tickets, screenshots, all that good stuff.
    4. A clear need and expectation - Are you looking for approval? Feedback? A decision? Tell them!

    <h3>Go synchronous when it gets synchronous</h3>


    <h3>Lead by example</h3>

    <h3>Documentation Scales</h3>
    Writing something down scales knowledge. You don't have to keep having meetings to describe stuff to people, if you leave there is still some context around, and if new peoplejoin you don't have to remember and talk through every idea or decision you've ever made.
