<h1>Manifesto for Managers working in Async Software Development</h1>

<blockquote cite="https://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/">
"Asynchronous communication means I can take a step out for lunch and catch up on transcripts when I get back. Asynchronous communication means I can ask my coworker a question in-chat and not worry about bothering her since she’ll get back to me when she’s available. Asynchronous communication means I can go to rural Minnesota and feel like I’m working from the office like normal."
</blockquote>
- Zach Holman of GitHub

<h2>Values</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Transparent and public communication over information control.</li>
  <li>Flexible working hours over synchronised schedules.</li>
  <li>Written information over verbal meetings.</li>
  <li>Remote-working over co-location.</li>
  <li>Trust and ownership over task delegation.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Principles</h2>
<h3>Meetings as a last resort</h3>
Meetings are <a href="https://meetingking.com/meeting-cost-calculator/">really expensive</a>.

<h3>Sync time is limited but important, use it well.</h3>

<h3>Overcommunicate by default. More than you are comfortable with.</h3>
It's cheap. Lose the ego. It's incredibly valuable.
