    <blockquote cite="https://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/">
      <p>"Asynchronous communication means I can take a step out for lunch and catch up on transcripts when I get back. Asynchronous communication means I can ask my coworker a question in-chat and not worry about bothering her since she’ll get back to me when she’s available. Asynchronous communication means I can go to rural Minnesota and feel like I’m working from the office like normal."</p>

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Transparent and public communication over information control.</li>
      <li>Flexible working hours over synchronised schedules.</li>
      <li>Written information over verbal meetings.</li>
      <li>Remote-working over co-location.</li>
      <li>Trust and ownership over task delegation.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <h3>Meetings as a last resort</h3>
    <p>Meetings are <a href="https://meetingking.com/meeting-cost-calculator/">really expensive</a>. Whenever you need to talk to someone or share some info or collaborate on an idea, always ask yourself how you can do it in an asynchronous way first. Once those options are exhausted, a meeting might be the last resort.</p>

    <h3>Sync time is limited, and it's not just yours to use up, so use it well</h3>
    <p>Sync time or meetings are not evil, and sometimes they can be useful. But, you have a very limited amount of sync time in the work week. If you ask people you work with how many hours they would genuinely choose to be in meetings each week, it will likely be a very small number. So remember, when you force synchronous communication you are also taking up all that precious time from other people as well.</p>

    <h3>Overcommunicate by default, more than you are comfortable with</h3>
    <p>It's cheap. Don't worry about people "not being interested" in all the details. It's incredibly valuable because in async you can't rely on fast follow ups, so giving more context and considering what someone might ask straight away means you can already provide those answers.</p>

    Here's what you should include:
    <ol>
      <li>Enough details to cover follow up questions - don't let it turn into a long delayed conversation.</li>
      <li>Response time expectations - when do you need an answer?</li>
      <li>As much context and supporting info as possible - documentation, tickets, screenshots, all that good stuff.</li>
      <li>A clear need and expectation - Are you looking for approval? Feedback? A decision? Tell them!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Go synchronous when it gets synchronous</h3>

    <h3>Lead by example</h3>

    <h3>Documentation Scales</h3>
    Writing something down scales knowledge. You don't have to keep having meetings to describe stuff to people, if you leave there is still some context around, and if new peoplejoin you don't have to remember and talk through every idea or decision you've ever made.
