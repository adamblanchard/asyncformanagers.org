      <p><i>"Asynchronous communication means I can take a step out for lunch and catch up on transcripts when I get back. Asynchronous communication means I can ask my coworker a question in-chat and not worry about bothering her since sheâ€™ll get back to me when sheâ€™s available. Asynchronous communication means I can go to rural Minnesota and feel like Iâ€™m working from the office like normal."</i></p>

    <h2>ðŸ’­ Values</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Transparent and public communication over information control.</li>
      <li>Written information over verbal meetings.</li>      
      <li>Flexible working hours over synchronised schedules.</li>
      <li>Remote-working over co-location.</li>
      <li>Trust and ownership over task delegation.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>ðŸ“œ Principles</h2>
    <h3>Meetings as a last resort</h3>
    <p>Meetings are an easy option but realise that they are <a href="https://meetingking.com/meeting-cost-calculator/" target="_blank">really expensive</a>. Whenever you need to talk to someone, always ask yourself how you can do it in an asynchronous way first. Once those options are exhausted, a meeting can be your last option.</p>

    <h3>Sync time is limited, and it's not just yours to use up, so use it appropriately</h3>
    <p>Sync time or meetings are not evil but you do have a very limited amount of it available in a day. If you ask someone how many hours they would genuinely choose to be in meetings each day, it would likely be a very small number. Remember, when you invite someone to talk you are taking away their precious uninterupted focus time.</p>
    <p>Instead, focus on finding the <i>right</i> time to make use of it. If you sense some conflict or misunderstanding, need to build some human connection with people (useful when working remotely), or otherwise need to collaborate in real time, go for it.</p>

    <h3>Overcommunicate in public by default</h3>
    <p>Overcommunicating is valuable because in async you can't (and shouldn't) rely on instant replies, so giving more context and considering what someone might ask straight away means you can proactively squish follow ups being necessary. </p>

    Here's what you should include:
    <ol>
      <li>Enough details to cover follow up questions - don't let it turn into a long cycle conversation.</li>
      <li>Response time expectations - when do you need a reply by?</li>
      <li>As much context and supporting info as possible - documentation, tickets, screenshots, all that good stuff.</li>
      <li>A clear need and expectation - are you looking for approval? Feedback? A decision? Let them know.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Documentation is scalable</h3>
    Writing something down publicly builds scalable knowledge. You don't have to keep having the same meetings to relay the same info to different people. If new people join you don't have to remember all the important things and talk it through to each person. People can proactively find the info they need themselves. If you leave the team there is still some context around.
    
    <h3>Go synchronous when it gets synchronous</h3>
    If you end up having a real time discussion in slack or email, realise that you might be able to communicate more effectively on a call. If you do this, remember to follow up with a written summary so those who missed it can catch up asynchronously.
    
    <h3>Lead by example</h3>
    As a manager, the most effective way you can influence a successful asynchronous culture is to live by the values yourself. Don't ask a team to send public and async updates if you yourself call them into a meeting every time you need to tell them something.
